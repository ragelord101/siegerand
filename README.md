the randomizer file is essentially the backend of this poject that actually carries out all the calculations, views has the files for what you'll be seeing. later im gonna add a public folder that will contain style files and images
I'll need to set up an initial menu where the user is asked what characters they have so that the program knows what to draw from. after that I should create an array from the available characters that can be selected from later. i can set that up via buttons, should make the whole thing a little simpler for my friends. ill make a board with all the characters and buttons under each one to toggle their presence.
